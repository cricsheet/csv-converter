# csv-converter

A ruby script to convert [version 0.9](https://cricsheet.org/format/) [Cricsheet YAML data files](https://cricsheet.org/downloads/) into CSV.

The CSV generated is considered an **experimental** Cricsheet format. Originally CSV data was provided for only T20 and IPL matches, however that has now expanded to include all matches. The CSV version was originally created in response to a request for a simple version of the data in CSV format (rather than YAML). The data it generates is not as complete as the YAML data and, currently, does not fully support all fields. A list of [known limitations](#known-limitations) can be found below.

The data generated is similar to, but **not exactly the same as**, that provided on the [Cricsheet downloads](https://cricsheet.org/downloads/) page. The data generated by the `convert.rb` script does not include values for `season`, `match_number`, `series`, `reserve_umpire`, `tv_umpire`, or `match_referee`, unlike that provided on the website. A future version of this converter will include these fields.

## What has happened to the project?

TLDR: Project (`cricsheet/csv-converter`) is now [hosted on Sourcehut](https://code.deeden.co.uk/cricsheet-csv-converter) due to GitHub's continued collaboration with ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement).

Hello :wave:, nice to see you! If you're here you're presumably looking for the project (`cricsheet-csv-converter`) that used to be here. The project still exists, it has just moved elsewhere. Let me tell you both why, and where you can find the project now.

Given GitHub's [ongoing policy of collaborating with ICE](https://thenextweb.com/politics/2019/10/09/github-microsoft-trump-ice-contract/) I don't feel comfortable supporting the platform ([as](https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2019/10/24/085956/) [I've](https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2019/11/15/094544/) [mentioned](https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2019/11/20/160118/) [elsewhere](https://deeden.co.uk/notes/2020/04/14/165427/)), so I've gradually moved all of my repositories (both private and public) elsewhere.

I've hoped that GitHub would cancel their policy ([as do many of the staff](https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/letter-from-github-employees-to-ceo-about-the-company-s-ice-contract/fb280de9-2bc3-40d5-b1a5-e3b954bf0d25/), including good people I know), but nothing has happened, so I've moved. You can find the [project at Sourcehut](https://code.deeden.co.uk/cricsheet-csv-converter), as well as [issue tracking](https://code.deeden.co.uk/cricsheet-csv-converter/issues). [Patches](https://code.deeden.co.uk/cricsheet-csv-converter/patches) will also still be gratefully received.
